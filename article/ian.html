	<h1>Cybersecurity</h1>
	<p>Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting digital devices, networks, and information from unauthorized access, theft, damage, or disruption.</p>
	
	<h2>Why is cybersecurity important?</h2>
	<p>In today's digital age, organizations and individuals rely heavily on technology to carry out daily activities. This reliance has increased the risk of cyber threats and attacks, which can result in significant financial and reputational damage. Cybersecurity helps to safeguard against these threats and protect sensitive data from falling into the wrong hands.</p>
	
	<h2>Types of cybersecurity threats</h2>
	<p>There are various types of cyber threats, including:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Malware (e.g. viruses, worms, Trojans) that infects and damages devices or steals data</li>
		<li>Phishing attacks that trick individuals into revealing sensitive information or downloading malware</li>
		<li>Ransomware that encrypts data and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key</li>
		<li>Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks that overload networks and systems, causing them to crash or become unavailable</li>
		<li>Social engineering attacks that exploit human weaknesses (e.g. trust, fear, curiosity) to gain access to systems or data</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Cybersecurity best practices</h2>
	<p>Some best practices for staying safe online include:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Using strong, unique passwords and two-factor authentication</li>
		<li>Keeping software and security patches up to date</li>
		<li>Avoiding suspicious emails, links, and downloads</li>
		<li>Encrypting sensitive data and using secure connections (e.g. HTTPS)</li>
		<li>Limiting access to sensitive information to authorized personnel only</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>By following these practices and staying vigilant, individuals and organizations can help protect themselves against cyber threats and maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data.</p>
